This thesis is about identifying the signalling effect that an environmental certification like Singapore's Green Mark provides. Data on housing transactions are obtained from the [Real Estate Information System (REALIS)](https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm), and data about Green Mark awards are scraped from the [BCA Green Mark Buildings Directory](https://www.bca.gov.sg/green_mark/KnowledgeResources/BuildingDirectory.aspx). A difference-in-difference approach is used to identify the effect of the BCA Green Mark certification award on housing prices.
