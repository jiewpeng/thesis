This thesis is about identifying the intangible award effects that an environmental certification like Singapore's Green Mark provides, separating them from other effects such as energy savings or unobserved quality differences between GM-rated and non-GM rated properties. Data on housing transactions are obtained from the [Real Estate Information System (REALIS)](https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm), and data about Green Mark awards are scraped from the [BCA Green Mark Buildings Directory](https://www.bca.gov.sg/green_mark/KnowledgeResources/BuildingDirectory.aspx). A difference-in-difference approach is used to identify the intangible effects of the BCA Green Mark certification award on housing prices.
