# Introduction

In recent years, numerous green building certification schemes have been developed, "aimed at mitigating the impact of buildings on the natural environment through sustainable design" [@Vierra2016]. Many of these certifications focus on rating the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings. 

This drive towards sustainable design started in the 1990s with the Building Research Establishment (BRE) Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), and was followed in 2000 by the U.S. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system [@Vierra2016]. This drive for environmental sustainability in products and buildings accelerated in recent years due to growing concerns about environmental issues.

Certification encourages the construction of green buildings because by reducing information asymmetries associated with green buildings, which cause potential buyers not to fully price in the benefits of green technology [@Matisoff2016]. While green features provide tangible and intangible benefits such as lower electricity bills and better environment, these features are unobservable at the demand side before purchase. Some of these features such as material sourcing might not even be observable after purchase. This problem is similar to the "market for lemons" problem [@Akerlof1970], where potential buyers cannot differentiate between the presence and absence of green features. As a result, there is a pooling equilibrium where potential buyers/tenants are not willing to pay more for green features which landlords or developers claim to exist. Assuming green features require additional costs to build in, the lack of price premiums means that building in green features leads to lower profits. Developers and constructors will choose not to build in green features to their buildings because the additional costs are not covered by a corresponding price premium.

A credible certification can verify these unobservable green characteristics and hence act as a signal to potential buyers about the green features and quality of the building. This would result in a price premium for green features, which would justify the additional costs required to build green buildings, increasing the construction of these buildings.

Some literature have shown that the costs of building green features are actually not that high. These studies have demonstrated that the average cost premium for green buildings are only about 1% to 2% [see @Bartlett2000; also @Kats2003]. As such, the price premium required to justify the inclusion of green or energy efficient features is not that high.

Regardless, even if the cost premiums are low, these cost premiums still need to be offset by a corresponding price premium. Buyers and tenants are unwilling to pay for green features not because they do not value green features, but because they cannot observe them before the purchase or rental agreement. A certification is required as a signal or assurance of quality, to allow potential tenants and buyers to price in the benefits from the green features.

## Green Mark (GM) Certification in Singapore

The Green Mark scheme was launched in January 2005 by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of Singapore to encourage the construction of more environmentally friendly and energy efficient buildings. The GM scheme rates and certifies buildings according to five main criteria: energy efficiency, water efficiency, environmental protection, indoor environmental quality, and other green and innovative features [@BCAAssessment].

Buildings which apply for the GM certification would be assessed on the criteria listed above, and would be scored on a points basis, and then these scores would be converted to an award type (Certified, Gold, Gold Plus, Platinum) based on the scores. 

In order to encourage developers to incorporate Green Building Technologies (GBTs) into their developments, the BCA set aside $20 million on the Green Mark Incentive Scheme (GMIS) in 2006. This is a scheme aimed at accelerating the adoption of green technologies, by providing cash incentives to developers, building owners, architects and mechanical and electrical (M&E) engineers who "make efforts to achieve at least a BCA Green Mark Gold rating or higher". The cash incentives would be split into two stages: half of which would be disbursed upon successful certification during the design or construction stage, and the remaining would be disbursed after validation, one year after the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) date.

## Aim of Study

The aim of this paper is to explore the signalling effects of an environmental certification or award. The signalling effects of environmental certifications are important because these certifications are meant to incentivise certain behaviour, in this case, constructing energy efficient buildings. In order for certifications to incentivise private companies to adopt certain practices, they need to act as credible signals, i.e. provide a price premium to offset the cost premium associated with "good behaviour". 

This study uses a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to study the signalling effects of the GM award. It studies how the GM award affects prices of housing units. A certification can affect the price of a housing unit either by providing information (information effect), or by signalling unobservable characteristics (signalling effect). By examining how prices of GM properties appreciate compared to non-GM properties after they receive the GM award, the signalling effect can be isolated from the information effect. This is because the green features of GM properties would already have been marketed to potential home buyers before the GM property officially receives the GM award, and hence the GM award provides no new information.
