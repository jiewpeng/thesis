# INTRODUCTION

The aim of this paper is to explore the signalling effects of a certification or award. The signalling effects of environmental certifications are important because these certifications are meant to incentivise certain behaviour, in this case, constructing energy efficient buildings. In order for certifications to incentivise private companies to adopt certain practices, they need to act as credible signals, i.e. provide a price premium to offset the cost premium associated with "good behaviour". Certifications probide a price premium through information as well as signalling unobservable quality; this paper uses a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to isolate the signalling effect from the information provided by the award. 

Certification is required to incentivise the construction of green buildings because information asymmetries associated with green buildings imply that the market will not provide green buildings as it is not profitable to do so [@Matisoff2016]. While green features provide tangible and intangible benefits such as lower electricity bills and better environment, these features are unobservable at the demand side before purchase. Some of these features such as material sourcing might not even be observable after purchase. This problem is similar to the lemon market problem, where potential buyers cannot differentiate between the presence and absence of green features. As a result, there is a pooling equilibrium where potential buyers/tenants are not willing to pay more for green features which landlords or developers claim to exist. Assuming green features require additional costs to build in, the lack of price premiums means that building in green features leads to lower profits. Developers and constructors will choose not to build in green features to their buildings because the additional costs are not covered by a corresponding price premium.

A credible certification can verify these unobservable green characteristics and hence act as a signal to potential buyers about the green features and quality of the building.
